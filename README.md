# sharing-points

 **This project is for educational purpose only**

#### My point is to work and with Scala, play framework, and actor programming (akka)

> The app simulates a bicycle sharing system.

> It is be possible to create a sharing point with available bicycles. Order a bicycle in a sharing point. 

> The app returns how many bicycles are available in the sharing points.

> Each sharing point is an akka actor, and each actor holds it's state. (number of bicycles ...)

#### Next steps 

> Book bikes on specific sharing points, and update actor's state
