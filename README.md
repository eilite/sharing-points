# sharing-points

### This project is for educational purpose only

*My point is to hack with Scala, play framework,and actor programming (akka)

> The app simulates a bicycle sharing system.

> It should be possible to create a sharing point with available bicycles. Order a bicycle in a sharing point.

> The app should also tell how many bicycles are available in the sharing points nearby a given location.

> Each sharing point should be modeled into an actor, and each actor should hold it's state. (number of bicycles, locations ...)
